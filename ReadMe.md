# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This program implements a variation of a Vigenere cipher to encrypt or decrypt text files.

The purpose of developing this program was for me to learn the basics of C++.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The program uses variables, expressions, conditions, loops, functions, classes, and a vector.

This was made using C++ and uses the following libraries:
The Input/Output Stream Library, the File Stream Library, the C Standard Library, and the Standard Template Library.
